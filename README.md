## what is yeoman
Yeoman is a generic scaffolding system allowing the creation of any kind of app. It allows for rapidly getting started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.

Here are some common use cases:

Rapidly create a new project\
Create new sections of a project, like a new controller with unit tests\
Create modules or packages\
Bootstrapping new services\
Enforcing standards, best practices and style guides\
Promote new projects by letting users get started with a sample app\
Etc, etc\
